    <h2>The State of the Honeybee</h2>
    <p class="indent"> You'd have to be living under a rock somewhere to not know that our pollinators are in trouble. While the media has been crucial in spreading awareness, a lot of attention has been focused in areas that make people feel like they're helping, but don't actually help.
    <p class="indent">The other day, a friend forwarded me a link to a Cheerios campaign to save the bees. As I read it, though, I realized it was just a marketing scheme. They were giving out free packets of wildflower seeds. And while bees face many problems, starving to death in suburbia in the middle of the summer is not one of them.
    <p class="indent">The problem with campaigns like this is that they confuse the actual, complex problems facing bees with simple <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Slacktivist">slacktivist</a> solutions that make a person feel better without doing anything. (Though I must admit, I did claim my free packet of seeds.)

    <h2>Identify a Bee vs a Wasp</h2>
    <p>Many people who claim to hate bees, actually hate wasps.
    <div>
      <strong>Bees are:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>fuzzy and cute</li>
        <li>herbivorous</li>
        <li>beneficial for pollination</li>
        <li>disinclined to sting you unless you threaten their home</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      <strong>On the other hand, Wasps are:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>psychotic, murderous jerks</li>
        <li>carnivorous</li>
        <li>beneficial for pest control since they eat other bugs</li>
        <li>likely to sting you for looking at them funny</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Other Websites</h2>
    <img id="bush-bees" src="bush-bees.png" alt="The website and source code">
    <p class="indent">One of the first websites I found while learning about beekeeping was <a href="http://www.bushfarms.com/bees.htm">Bush Bees</a>. It has a lot of great content, offering the author's advice and expertise. He does a lot of experimentation on beekeeping methods, which I find fascinating. I admire his commitment to natural and low human-intervention beekeeping.
    <p class="indent">The layout on the other hand, has always bothered me. Photo thumbnails are crammed onto the page and clicking on one opens the link in the current window. The list of content down the side does allow you to see everything offered, but is too long. Surely there is a better navigation method?
    <p class="indent">Opening up the Page Source shows a lot more stuff going on than I anticipated. There are a ton of keywords for SEO and a page content summary. The links on the side also are arranged in categories, which I never noticed because I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of links.
    <p class="indent"> It's also fun to see the notes of whoever made the site and was playing with the screen sizing. I had assumed it would be all auto-generated stuff.

Challenge Objectives:
Using Git Workflow and a feature branch, create an index.html file in your newly cloned repository. Add in content and HTML to briefly describe your website topic.

Add content to your site (don't forget to commit often to demonstrate Git workflow!). Your site should include:
  -the basic HTML structure elements found on every HTML page
  -some content that mixes header and paragraph tags
  -at least one image
  -at least two block-level elements that give semantic   meaning to content
  -a table or form (you can submit to httpbin if you like, or to the other page of your site)
  -a list
  -at least one additional page that is linked from index.html

Find an existing website about your topic (or similar). What makes this site good or bad? Look at the source code (View Source). Do you recognize any HTML elements? Try to guess what the things you don't recognize do. Add a link to this website and a few sentences about what makes it good or bad to your index.html page.

Validate your HTML code with an HTML validator (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Update your repository on GitHub using GitHub Workflow.
Navigate to your website in a new browser tab http://<USERNAME>>.github.io to verify that your site is live.

Submit the URL for the site, so we can view your beautiful work!
