  <p> You'd have to be living under a rock somewhere to not know that our pollinators are in trouble. While the media has been crucial in spreading awareness, a lot of attention has been focused in areas that make people feel like they're helping, but don't actually help.
  <h2>Will no one save the bees?</h2>
  <p>A well-meaning friend forwarded me article about a Cheerios campaign to save the bees. As I read it, though, I realized it was just a cheap marketing idea. They were giving out free packets of wildflower seeds. And while bees face many problems, starving to death in suburbia in the middle of the summer is not one of them.
  <p>The problem with campaigns like this is that they confuse the actual, complex problems facing bees with simple <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Slacktivist">slacktivist</a> solutions that make a person feel better without doing anything.

  <h2>Identify a Bee vs a Wasp</h2>
  <p>Many people who claim to hate bees, actually hate wasps. Bees are cute, fuzzy, and disinclined to sting you unless you threaten their home. Wasps on the other hand, are psychotic, murderous jerks who will sting you for looking at them funny.
  <p>Please compare the nightmare beasts below with the fuzzy, cute critters at the bottom.

  <h2>Other Websites</h2>
    <img src="bush-bees.png" alt="The website and source code" width="600px">
  <p>One of the first websites I found while learning about beekeeping was <a href="http://bushfarms.com/bees">Bush Bees</a>. It has a lot of great content, offering the author's advice and expertise. He does a lot of experimentation on beekeeping methods, which I find fascinating. I admire his commitment to low human intervention beekeeping. The layout on the other hand, has always bothered me. Photo thumbnails are crammed onto the page and clicking on one opens the link in the current window. The list of content down the side does allow you to see everything offered, but is too long. Surely there is a better navigation method?
  <p>Opening up the Page Source shows a lot more stuff going on than I anticipated. There are a ton of keywords for SEO and a page content summary. The links on the side also are arranged in an order, though they display, which I never noticed because I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of links.
  <p> It's also fun to see the notes of whoever made the site and was playing with the screen sizing. I had assumed it would be all auto-generated stuff.
