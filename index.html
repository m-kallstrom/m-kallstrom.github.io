<h1>Beekeeping</h1>

<h2>How I got started</h2>
<h2>Will no one save the bees?</h2>
<p>There's a lot about "saving" the bees in the media. A well-meaning friend forwarded me a link to a Cheerios campaign, which was giving away wildflower seeds under the guise of saving the bees. The problem with campaigns like this is that they confuse the actual, complex problems facing bees with simple slacktivism solutions that make a person feel better without doing anything.
<h2>Things that actually help bees</h2>

list threats to bees


Buy local honey
Learn to identify bees and if you see a swarm, call a beekeeper instead of killing it.
Read the label before you spray pesticides on your plants
Vote
Write your local government about strengthening protections
Support small farms-- monoculture is a threat to bees

Identify a bee vs a wasp
Wasps are jerks. No one likes them. Bees are fuzzy and cute and disinclined to sting you unless you threaten them. Wasps crave death.
If you own your property in a bee-friendly area, offer your land to a beekeeper.


  <h2>Other Websites</h2>
    <img src="bush-bees.png" alt="The website and source code">
  <p>One of the first websites I found while learning about beekeeping was <a href="http://bushfarms.com/bees">Bush Bees</a>. It has a lot of great content, offering the author's advice and expertise. He does a lot of experimentation on beekeeping methods, which I find fascinating. I admire his commitment to low human intervention beekeeping. The layout on the other hand, has always bothered me. Photo thumbnails are crammed onto the page and clicking on one opens the link in the current window. The list of content down the side does allow you to see everything offered, but is too long. Surely there is a better navigation method?
  <p>Opening up the Page Source shows a lot more stuff going on than I anticipated. There are a ton of keywords for SEO and a page content summary. The links on the side also are arranged in an order, though they display, which I never noticed because I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of links.
  <p> It's also fun to see the notes of whoever made the site and was playing with the screen sizing. I had assumed it would be all auto-generated stuff.
